## A helping hand outside the kitchen



### Motivation

Between online recipe sites, instructional videos on YouTube, and the ubiquitous Tasty content cluttering our Facebook feeds, 
the internet has made it easier than ever to learn about cooking. But in spite of all the information available about what to 
do in the kitchen, an online culinary education fails to teach amateur cooks to navigate their local grocery store. Regardless of 
how competent one might be in front of the stove, the produce section is another challenge entirely.

Furthermore, in a place like our humble Williamstown, MA, many of the ingredients in recipes dreamed up by chefs in cities simply 
aren’t available. There ought to be a platform which helps people to understand and utilize their local ingredients to the fullest.


### Analysis

There are a number of factors to consider when purchasing produce:

* Is this fruit or vegetable in season?
* How do I tell if this is ripe, and how long will it keep?
* What is the nutritional information about this produce?
* Does it grow in my region? Local vegetables will invariably be fresher and therefore more desirable.
* And of course, What can I make with this?

The idea behind Sous Shopper is to help keep track of information relating to the quality of produce, while encouraging its users 
to be creative in their application of the légume. Our goal is to provide nutritional education to our community while eliminating
one of the greatest impediments to experiencing the joy of cooking.
Users will be able to view recipes from other users living in similar areas and 
submit their own as well. In addition to guiding cooks in the selection of their ingredients, it will also facilitate the exchange 
of information between community members.

### Improvements on Current Systems

There are services such as Blue Apron which let people avoid the difficulties of grocery shopping by sending its users predetermined 
ingredients and an accompanying recipe. By removing the user’s choice, services such as these create dependency in the user, and 
ultimately teaches them very little about cooking. We believe that most people would prefer to be self-sufficient, they just don’t know 
where to start. Sous Shopper aims to actually educate its users about picking their own ingredients; to take control of the cooking 
process from start to finish, and make something they can be proud of.
