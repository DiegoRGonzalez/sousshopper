### Preliminary Information
We will communicate via Facebook messenger


### Guiding Principles
- Do your work
- Go to each meeting
- Be the kind of team member that you want to have

Any decisions will be decided by a team vote. If a team member has lost the vote but feels strongly about their choice, they can state their reasoning and the other team members must listen respectfully. However, afterwards the team will vote again and all team members must abide by the majority-voted decision.


### Preliminary Focus on Purpose
Our goal is to build an application that will educate users about the produce in their lives.


### Dividing Up the Task
Upon discussion, we discovered that we all have very similar skillsets. With this in mind, we plan on assigning tasks on a case by case basis.
That being said, each member has been assigned a task-domain over which they will be in charge. This will entail making sure that those tasks are done, whether by delegation or by completing the tasks themselves.

### Meeting Management
Every Saturday, our group will meet from 4-6pm in Schow library to go over the past week's assignments and how their execution went. During this meeting we will also develop a plan for the following week and assign tasks accordingly.

An optional Tuesday meeting from 4-6pm can be used for collaboration on assignments and for various purposes outlined below. Every team member has agreed to keep this timeslot available regardless of whether a Tuesday meeting is planned for that week.


### Accountability Processes
During each meeting, tasks assigned will be documented in a post on the project webpage.


### Rewards and Punishments
In cases where the team wants to acknowledge the accomplishments of the team or a single team member, fresh produce will be brought to the next meeting where the accomplishment will be celebrated at the start of the meeting.

In cases where a member of the team has failed to perform their assigned duties, any other team member is able to call a Tuesday meeting where the failure can be discussed.

### Follow-Up
If a team member would like to address an issue with another team member or with the team contract, a Tuesday meeting can be called where those matters will be discussed.
