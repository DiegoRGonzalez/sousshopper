## Tasks

### Selecting Produce base on Ripeness and shelf life - Medium Task
Genevieve is an undergraduate student who has moved into a new apartment for a summer internship at an investment firm. Because she has little free time, she only gets to go to the grocery store once every two weeks, which can make shopping for fruit very difficult. She wants to buy bananas in varying degrees of ripeness so that she can have one for breakfast every day until her next visit to the store. At the produce aisle, Genevieve opens her SousShopper phone app and searches for bananas. Once she has navigated to the appropriate page she compares the bananas in the store to the images on the ripeness spectrum, and selects 3 bananas which are ripe now, 4 which will be ripe in 4-6 days, 3 that will ripen in 1-1.5 weeks, and 4 that should be ripe in 1.5-2 weeks.

He opens up his SousShopper app on his phone, searches for rutabagas, and navigates to information about them. Tran discovers that they are a good source of vitamin C, have a taste somewhere between a turnip and a cabbage, and they can be served roasted, mashed, or even made into french fries. Consulting the app’s ripeness meter, he picks a few rutabagas and goes home excited to experiment with his new ingredient.

## Design 1: Grocery List

This design is centered around the creation of a grocery list and the management of bought produce. First a user fills their list with what they would like to buy. From here, they can look up information about the produce as well as selection techniques. Once the produce has been bought, it moves to the pantry list that keeps track of what has been  bought and alerts the user when the produce is about to spoil.
