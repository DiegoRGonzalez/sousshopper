title: Directed Story-Telling Interview
---

### Who did you interview? What is their background? What was the environment?
This particular interview was done on the Williams College campus. We interviewed Jane, an administrative assistant at the college. Jane lives in the area and regularly shops for groceries at either Wild Oats or Stop and Shop. Most of her reported experience with produce is from trips to the store with her mother while growing up, but she also has prior work experience with a vegetable farm and even maintained her own garden as a hobby at some point in the past. Other than grocery stores, Jane likes to go to the farmers' market for seasonal fruits, specifically mentioning going for berries in the summer.

### Jane's Story
As previously stated, Jane frequently buys groceries from either Wild Oats or Stop and Shop. Specifically, midweek last week, Jane went grocery shopping at Stop and Shop. Going by herself, she only brought along a list. The isles she visited were the natural/organic produce, bakery, and cereal isles, purchasing most of what was on her list.

### What did you learn?
Jane bases her choices of produce to pick on a myriad of factors. She generally prefers natural/organic brands to regular brands regardless of the price difference as well as exhibits personal preferences for certain types of produce. For example, Jane prefers Gala and Golden Delicious apples. However, her deciding factor on what she buys falls upon perceived freshness. For example, Jane chooses firmer avocados because she knows it will last a couple of days rather than for just when she buys it. This overarching trend is what we have seen in previous interviews as well as in daily observations. Due to prior planning, certain produce is bought with longevity and not having to return to the market too often in mind rather than which is the ripest.

Jane also exhibited some preferences in choosing produce not mentioned before in previous interviews. Specifically, she brought up examining the expiration dates on produce and choosing dates farther away. While in hindsight makes sense, it was an aspect of shopping previously never brought up. Also, Jane made the point that while looks are important, she is willing to choose produce that isn’t perfect looking. Due to her previous work on a vegetable farm, she has learned not to care if produce is asymmetrical, "ugly", or “funny-looking”. However, she does draw the line when produce starts looking bruised or old. She also claimed this has made her more open to choosing larger varieties of produce.

Through the interview we learned more about what are staples in the behaviors of the average shopper as well as key things to consider including in the design of Sous Shopper.

### Any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?
There were some stark differences between the first inquiry with Brian and the interview with Jane. In terms of establishing a rapport, the flow of conversation was a bit different in that it was a 1 on 1 interview, and it was no longer between students. The only "real difficulty" came from the type of interview conducted. After experiencing the on-the-spot observations gained from a contextual inquiry, it felt as if there were certain aspects of the shopping experience glossed over when recounted in an after-the-fact story. Even with asking questions to try and probe for more insights, there was no constant stream of information returned. What was returned was mainly summary-like replies where while the perceived important parts were indeed highlighted, some possible key implicit recounts were skipped. However, this may well be affected by the topic leaning on the side of being mundane or commonplace so as to not stick in one's memory as vividly.

### What remains to be pursued?
While the different kinds of people being interviewed has increased, more contextual inquiries would help in solidifying which aspects of grocery shopping are consistent along most, if not all, boards.
