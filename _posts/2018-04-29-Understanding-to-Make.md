## Problem and Solution Overview

Between online recipe sites, instructional videos on YouTube, and the ubiquitous Tasty content cluttering our Facebook feeds, the internet has made it easier than ever to learn about cooking. But in spite of all the information available about what to do in the kitchen, an online culinary education fails to teach amateur cooks to navigate their local grocery store. Our proposed solution is to create a phone app which will help shoppers become more confident in the produce aisle by teaching them how to recognize the ripeness of fruits and vegetables, familiarizing them with the seasonality of produce, and providing nutritional information about the goods they eat.


## Initial Paper Prototype

Our initial paper prototype was designed to accentuate our two main tasks while also providing a similar tactile feel to how the product is intended to function. The tasks are determining when a certain produce is in season and determining what is the best of a certain produce to buy based on the ripeness and the buyer's personal preference.

![Overview](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/overview.jpg)

### Task 1: Determining When Produce is in Season
![Pantry](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/pantry_page.jpg)

The application starts on the homepage, which uses a pantry metaphor layout where crates specifying certain categories of produce sit on shelves.

![Pantry Scroll](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/pantry_swipe.gif)
The user can scroll through the shelves and click on a desired crate.

![List Scroll](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/list_swipe.gif)
The app navigates to a list of produce items metaphorically contained within the crate. The user can scroll through the list as well as click on the desired produce to learn more information.

![Apple Click](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/apple_click.jpg)
For the current task, the desired produce is apples.

![Apple Page](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/apple_page.jpg)
The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, the default tab opened is the Freshness tab. Here, the user can see the meter showing what range of time of the year the produce is most in season.

### Task 2: Determining Produce Choice Based on Ripeness and Personal Preference
![List Scroll](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/list_swipe.gif)
Navigating up to this point is the same for both tasks.

![Banana Click](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/banana_click.jpg)
For the current task, the desired produce is bananas.

![Banana Page](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/banana_page.jpg)
The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, and again defaulting to the Freshness tab.

![Banana Swipe](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/ripe_swipe.gif)
(Paper prototype was a bit finicky after being in a folder for a day.)

Here, the user can also see a ripeness scale, in the form of a slider, showing the different levels of ripeness of the produce over time. Each level in the scale comes with a picture and a short description about the produce's qualities and longevity at that certain level. With this knowledge, the user can determine which produce in the grocery store most matches the level of ripeness preferred.

### Errors
![Error Page](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/error_page.jpg)
In case the user wanders to any page not currently created, there is an error page, where the user is only allowed to return to the previous page.


## Testing Process

### Method

For our usability testing, we presented our participants with our paper prototype and gave them a series of simple tasks that we felt were representative of our app. While the participants were using the prototype they were instructed to vocalize their thought process, and we recorded this audio. Over time, we got better at instructing our participants on how to think aloud. We found it helpful to have participants read a prompt aloud to get them in the mindset of externalizing thoughts. We also found it helpful to specify the type of feedback we were looking for: any thoughts about the layout, overall design, or deliberate aesthetic choices. Without this prompt, we had a shy user who was nervous about sharing irrelevant opinions and a particularly vocal user who complained about the low-fi look of the paper prototype and became hung up on this issue instead of giving us feedback we could implement. 

### Participants

##### Testing 1: Stephen
 - Facilitator: Diego

Our first participant, Stephen, is a Williams College student who has been known to go grocery shopping. We chose to use Stephen as a participant because he uses various apps to help him navigate through his day. He has a weight calculator, a physical fitness app, and a grocery list app, among others, that he uses to help manage these tasks. For these reasons, he seemed like a person to test out our design with. The test was conducted in Stephen's common room in order to make it convenient for him. Diego conducted this usability test and acted as the "human computer" as well as the "flight attendant." One thing that was learned during the testing process was the need to go over the exact scenario in which this app would be used. There was some confusion over what stage of the grocery shopping the test would take place in, but after some clarification there was no more confusion. For future tests, we will make sure to extensively go over the scenario as well as ask participants if they fully understand the scenario before beginning the test.

##### Testing 2: Sam
 - Facilitator: David

Our second participant Sam, is also a Williams College student. She recently started buying groceries for herself and is interested particularly in apps that let her explore food options and plan meals. However, she uses planning and tracking apps daily. We chose Sam because she can offer a perspective of a user who is not too familiar with the subject matter but is comfortable enough using the platform. The environment was a neutral space in Sam’s dorm. This was chosen out of convenience for both the participant. As for the protocol, Sam was given background information about her role as a shopper where she had a few tasks to fulfill while shopping that utilized the app. While completing the tasks, Sam was to think-aloud about anything she was doing or noticing concerning her ability to perform the task. David performed the roles of the computer as well as the flight attendant. With Sam's consent, the audio of the testing was also recorded. In this test, the main revisions added to the protocol were giving more of background information, and recording the test As for the prototype, back-buttons and more status indicators were added. Sam's main points on the design

##### Testing 3: Daniela
 - Facilitator: Justin

Our third participant, Daniela, is yet another Williams College student. She did not start grocery shopping until her second year of college, and now does it occasionally. She was not exposed to a wide variety of vegetables growing up, and is interested in incorporating more into her diet for health reasons. Daniela offers the perspective of a user who is curious about new types of produce, and would rely on the app heavily to learn methods of selecting these unfamiliar fruits and vegetables. The testing was conducted in Daniela’s room for her convenience. She was given an explanation of what the usability test would entail and instructed to think aloud about any impressions she had regarding the design. Daniela was then given two tasks. Justin performed the roles of the human computer and the flight attendant. For reference purposes, the audio from the test was recorded with Daniela’s consent. Daniela’s largest concern was that the written content of the ripeness slider should be more fleshed-out and include more information regarding texture. Additionally she expressed that, while she found the navigation system perfectly usable, older and less tech-savvy users might find it confusing.

## Testing Results

Between heuristic evaluation and usability testing, we were able to uncover a lot of flaws in our design. Here is a list of the areas where there was room for improvement, with the severity of the issues rated on a scale from 1 to 4. We’ve also included the revisions we made to address these issues, along with a picture of the revision.

### Main Screen/Pantry List
 - App's starting screen caused confusion as to where in the app the user was. - *Severity:* 2
 - A participant felt that the main page was too cluttered and would benefit from more pictures. - *Severity:* 2
 - A participant mentioned that the pantry list was very confusing to read, especially due to many vague categories. - *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Unnecessary/vague crates were removed from main screen.
 ![Main Screen Before & After](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/main_page_bna.png)

### Seasonal Chart Infographic
 - Participants thought the seasonal chart was confusing to read. - *Severity:* 1

### Ripeness Scale
 - Descriptions beneath the pictures in the scale were subjective towards one type of ripeness. - *Severity:* 3
 - There was no explanation for why there was no ripeness scale for apples. - *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Descriptions were altered to be less subjective.
 ![Example of Ripeness Scale Before & After](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/banana_scale_bna.png)

### Favorites
 - There was a *Favorites* crate at the top of the home screen without the functionality of actually adding produce to the crate. *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Clickable stars, indicating whether or not a certain produce was in the *Favorites*, were added as well as a separate produce list interface.
 ![New Favorites Indicator Stars](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/favorites.png)

### Back Buttons
 - Other than the *404 Page* there were no buttons to get back to a previous page. - *Severity:* 3
#### Revision:
 - Added back buttons arrows to the top-left corner of all pages but the main screen.
 ![New Back Arrow Buttons](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/favorites.png)

### Scrolling
 - Ability to scroll was not obvious. - *Severity:* 1


## Final Paper Prototype

Our paper prototype is designed to accentuate our two main tasks while also providing a similar tactile feel to how the product is intended to function. The tasks are determining when a certain produce is in season and determining what is the best of a certain produce to buy based on the ripeness and the buyer's personal preference.

![Overview](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/overview.png)

### Task 1: Determining When Produce is in Season
![Pantry](/sousshopper/img/PantriesFirstPage.jpg)
The application starts on the homepage, which uses a pantry metaphor layout where crates specifying certain categories of produce sit on shelves. The user can scroll through the shelves and click on a desired crate.

![Example List](/sousshopper/img/SingleProduceList.jpg)
The app navigates to a list of produce items metaphorically contained within the crate.

![All Lists](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/favorites.png)
Depending on which crate the user chooses one of the shown lists above become the page navigated to. The user can scroll through the list as well as click on the desired produce to learn more information. For the current task, the desired produce is apples.

![Apple Page](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/apple_page.png)
The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, the default tab opened is the Freshness tab. Here, the user can see the meter showing what range of time of the year the produce is most in season.

### Task 2: Determining Produce Choice Based on Ripeness and Personal Preference
![Example List](/sousshopper/img/SingleProduceList.jpg)
Navigating up to this point is the same for both tasks. For the current task, the desired produce is bananas.

![Banana Page](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/banana_page.png)
The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, and again defaulting to the Freshness tab. Here, the user can also see a ripeness scale, in the form of a slider, showing the different levels of ripeness of the produce over time. Each level in the scale comes with a picture and a short description about the produce's qualities and longevity at that certain level. With this knowledge, the user can determine which produce in the grocery store most matches the level of ripeness preferred.

![Apple Page](/sousshopper/img/FinalPaperPrototype/apple_page.png)
Note that there is no ripeness scale for apples. Unless there is a outwardly visual or tactile range of produce ripeness, like for bananas, a picture of a not-rotten piece of produce will be shown in place of the ripeness scale.


## Digital Mockup

### Overview
![Overview 1](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/collage 1.png)
![Overview 2](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/collage 2.png)
![Overview 3](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/collage 3.png)
![Overview 4](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/collage 4.png)

### Task 1: Selecting produce based on ripeness

![Home Page](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Page1.png)

This is our home page. From here, let’s find out how to judge if a banana is ripe or not. Let’s search alphabetically…

![Alphabetical Nav Page](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Alphabetical.png)

From here, we can see bananas pretty easily (we know there are more than 3 types of produce, this is just a prototype). Let’s go ahead and click on them.

![Bananas 1](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Banana1.png)

We’ve successfully navigated to our individual produce page. At the bottom, we see an image of a banana with a description of how it feels and tastes. By clicking on the arrow, we can advance to the next stage of ripeness.

![Bananas 2](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Banana2.png)

Here we see information about a slightly riper banana. We can go forwards to see more information, or backwards to recap. It looks like we’ve accomplished our task!

### Task 2: Determining when favorite produce is in season

![Home Page](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Page1.png)

Apologies for the redundancy, but this task is accomplished in much the same way. Let’s say we want to find out when tomatoes are in season. We can navigate to the tomato page in the same fashion as before, or we can observe the large, eye-catching banner which is telling us they’re in season right now.

![Tomatoes 1](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Tomato1.png)

Clicking on that button brings us to this page, where we can see the tomato’s seasonality in the chart on the upper left-hand side. It looks like tomatoes are in season from early Summer to late Fall. Mission accomplished!





## Changes from Paper Prototype to Digital Mock-Up
From our paper prototype to our digital mock-up, we made a few substantial changes.

### Adopted “Feature, Search, and Browse” Pattern
A few of our test subjects mentioned that they felt that our main page was not aesthetically pleasing enough, that it had too many words. Inspired by the necessity to add more images to our main page, we adopted the “Feature, Search, and Browse” pattern from Jenifer Tidwell’s “Designing Interfaces” where we include a featured item as well as the functionality to browse various categories and search for specific items. We feel this has made our main page more aesthetically pleasing as well as allowing for produce discovery, a task that we identified but decided to not focus on. However, as this change both fixes an issue and naturally adds in a way to discovery produce, it seemed like a good fit.

![Featured](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Page1.png)

### Removed Nutrition Facts and Meal Planning
On our produce pages in our paper prototype, we had tabs that would lead to that produce’s nutritional info as well as a list of meals that could be prepared using that produce. These functions were however not supported by our paper prototype as they were not the tasks that we were testing for. As they did not work, they simply added confusion to users. To rectify this, we removed those tabs from our design in an attempt to keep it simple.

## Discussion
This project as a whole has been very educational and informative. Though we had doubts as to the usefulness of paper prototyping and iterative design as a whole at the start, we can safely say now that they are an important and necessary step towards getting the design right.
One thing that we learned was that testing is absolutely necessary because it is surprisingly easy to forget to include important features into your design. One example of this is the lack of a back button on the initial version of our paper prototype. We had tested it ourselves, but as we knew how to perfectly execute our tasks, we never needed to go back. This was an issue that was invisible to us, but that was immediately found once we started testing. 
Testing was also useful because it helped us find the confusing aspects of our design. For our initial design, we came up with the pantry metaphor which we thought was really clever and useful. However, this was far from the truth. Our participants found the pantries to be confusing and the aesthetic to be off-putting. This is a good example of the fact that we are not our target demographic and that what we may think is a good design may not be whatsoever.
Another thing that we learned was how iterative design allowed us to be more open to new ideas. During the transition to the digital mock-up from the paper prototype, we decided to implement the "Feature, Browse, and Search" model. This radically changed the aesthetic from that of our paper prototype, but ended up being a positive change. We believe that we were more willing to make this sort of change since we were constantly revising and remaking our design. Had we drawn up our initial design and started creating a real app, we would be much more stuck with the issues of that initial design. 
We believe that through these various iterations, our design has incrementally improved. It is far from perfect however, and could be improved further by more iterations. In our digital mock-up, we made ripeness sliders for all the fruit that we included. This was not the case in our paper prototype, where we only included the banana slider as that was the fruit relevant to our specific task. However, after making the other produce sliders, we realized that determining ripeness is a unique process for each produce. Determining how to best assist in that ripeness selection requires much more research and more testing. We also have concerns with accessibility due to the visual nature of much of our descriptions. Through more iterative design and testing, we would most likely be able to fix these issues and come up with the best produce selection app possible.
That being said, we feel satisfied with the work we’ve done in the time that we had available.
