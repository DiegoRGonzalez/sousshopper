title: Paper Prototype
---

Our paper prototype is designed to accentuate our two main tasks while also providing a similar tactile feel to how the product is intended to function. The tasks are determining when a certain produce is in season and determining what is the best of a certain produce to buy based on the ripeness and the buyer's personal preference.

### Task 1: Determining When Produce is in Season
![Pantry](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/pantry_page.jpg)

The application starts on the homepage, which uses a pantry metaphor layout where crates specifying certain categories of produce sit on shelves.

![Pantry Scroll](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/pantry_swipe.gif)
The user can scroll through the shelves and click on a desired crate.

![List Scroll](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/list_swipe.gif)
The app navigates to a list of produce items metaphorically contained within the crate. The user can scroll through the list as well as click on the desired produce to learn more information.

![Apple Click](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/apple_click.jpg)
For the current task, the desired produce is apples.

The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, the default tab opened is the Freshness tab. Here, the user can see the meter showing what range of time of the year the produce is most in season.

### Task 2: Determining Produce Choice Based on Ripeness and Personal Preference

Navigating up to this point is the same for both tasks.

![Banana Click](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/banana_click.jpg)
For the current task, the desired produce is bananas.

![Banana Page](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/banana_page.jpg)
The app then navigates to the page containing tabs of categorized information about the desired produce, and again defaulting to the Freshness tab.

(Paper prototype was a bit finicky after being in a folder for a day.)

Here, the user can also see a ripeness scale, in the form of a slider, showing the different levels of ripeness of the produce over time. Each level in the scale comes with a picture and a short description about the produce's qualities and longevity at that certain level. With this knowledge, the user can determine which produce in the grocery store most matches the level of ripeness preferred.

### Errors
![Error Page](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/error_page.jpg)
In case the user wanders to any page not currently created, there is an error page, where the user is only allowed to return to the previous page.
