# Iterative Revisions
The following are our results from our inspection-based methods.

![Heuristic Evaluation 2](/sousshopper/img/HeuristicEvals/HeuristicEval2.jpg)

![Heuristic Evaluation 3](/sousshopper/img/HeuristicEvals/HeuristicEval3.jpg)

From these, we determined two main issues.
## Lack of back button
As was evident from two of our evaluations, once you had entered a page there was not a way to leave that page. To rectify this, we added back buttons to all the relevant pages in their upper left corner.

## No way to add to "Favorites"
We also discovered that though we had a "Favorites" pantry, we had no way of actually adding to it. In order to rectify this, we added buttons in the shape of stars to the produce pages to allow users to add to their "Favorites"

We also added a way to favorite produce from the list menu.

# First Usability Testing
Our first participant, Stephen, is a Williams College student who has been known to go grocery shopping. We chose to use Stephen as a participant because he uses various apps to help him navigate through his day. He has a weight calculator, a physical fitness app, and a grocery list app, among others, that he uses to help manage these tasks. For these reasons, he seemed like a person to test out our design with. The test was conducted in Stephen's common room in order to make it convenient for him. Diego conducted this usability test and acted as the "human computer" as well as the "flight attendant". One thing that was learned during the testing process was the need to go over the exact scenario in which this app would be used. There was some confusion over what stage of the grocery shopping the test would take place in, but after some clarification there was no more confusion. For future tests, we will make sure to extensively go over the scenario as well as ask participants if they fully understand the scenario before beginning the test.

## Results

1. No Splash Screen: The participant was confused as to the apps starting page, he suggested a splash screen that would welcome the user to the app. *Severity:* 1
2. Aesthetic: The participant felt that the main page was far too cluttered and would benefit from more pictures *Severity:* 2
3. Seasonal Chart Confusing: The participant vocalized that the seasonal chart was confusing to read. After some discussion, he agreed that the addition of colors would help to distinguish the various parts of the chart. *Severity:* 1
4. Subjective Terms in Ripeness scale: The participant did not like the words that were used to describe the various stages of the banana's ripeness, mentioning that good/bad were subjective terms. *Severity:* 3
5. Pantry List confusing: The participant mentioned that the pantry list was very confusing to read, especially due to the various categories. *Severity:* 2


The issues that we decided to fix are the following:
### Subjective Terms in Ripeness scale

![Banana Scale Before](/sousshopper/img/BananaScaleB4.jpg)
The Banana's ripeness scale at various points describes the stages as "good" or "bad". As our participant pointed out, whether or not a banana's stage is "good" or "bad" depends on the consumer themselves. We changed the language to only speak in objective terms about each stage.

### Pantry List Confusing
When the app opens, users are shown a list of various pantries with labels such as "Favorites", "Local", and even "Athletic". These were meant to be different orderings of produce to assist with whatever purpose people were searching for produce. Unfortunately, in our paper prototype, regardless of what was chosen, the same list would be shown.

![Pantries before](/sousshopper/img/Pantriesbefore.jpg)

![Single list](/sousshopper/img/SingleProduceList.jpg)

To clear up confusion, we have removed the extra pantries, leaving only the main ones such as "Favorites", "Local", and "Seasonal":

![Pantries after](/sousshopper/img/Pantriesafter.jpg)

On top of that, we have added separate search screens for each pantry:

# Current Paper Prototype
For our current paper prototype, users will first select the pantry ordering or the search bar from the main screen:
![Pantries](/sousshopper/img/PantriesFirstPage.jpg)

Then users will be given the appropriate search list depending on the pantry ordering they chose:
![Many lists](/sousshopper/img/manyproducelists.jpg)

Then users will either navigate to the apple page if their task is to determine the seasonality of an apple or the banana page if their task is to determine the ripeness of a banana:

# Plan for Future:
For our remaining two participants, Justin will conduct one test and David will conduct the other. Each of them will be testing participants who are Williams College students who shop for groceries.
