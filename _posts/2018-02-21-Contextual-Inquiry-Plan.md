title: Contextual Inquiry Plan
---

For our contextual inquiry we will be traveling to Stop and Shop and Wild Oats, two local grocery stores, and asking shoppers about their produce shopping habits. We will stand near the entrance to the produce section and ask any shoppers that enter the area if they would participate in our contextual inquiry. Specifically we will ask them the following question:
“Hi, we’re students from Williams College and we’re doing a study on people’s produce shopping habits. Would it be alright if we observed you as you selected your fruits and vegetables and then asked you some questions afterwards?” 

### Target Demographic

We plan to focus on younger individuals for out contextual inquiry, from 20 - 35 years of age. The reason for this is that we believe these individuals are more likely to seek out the assistance of a phone app for shopping.

### Interview Questions

Once we have found willing participants, we will explain our project in more detail and the purpose of our contextual inquiry. We will then shadow them as they select produce, and ask questions using the master/apprentice approach. The information we are looking for specifically is in regard to the process by which shoppers select their produce. Once they have completed their produce selection, we will ask a few interview questions that cover whatever topic was not covered during the shadowing. These questions may be some of the following:

* Do you have a grocery list, or do you decide on the spot?
  * If yes, what do you plan to buy?	
* How do you choose your produce?
  * Did you learn from anyone (i.e. a parent)?
  * Do you choose produce based on what’s in season?
  * Is it important to you that your produce is local?
* Are you open to discovering new kinds of produce?
