title: Contextual Inquiry Review

### Key Findings
The SousShopper team has completed our contextual inquiries, and we’re excited to share our findings! We conducted four inquiries in total: two contextual inquiries in Stop and Shop and two retrospective contextual inquiries using the directed storytelling method outlined in Martin and Hanington’s Universal Methods of Design. Our key findings were that overall the participants focused on price, longevity, and convenience with an overarching aspect of physical appeal when deciding what to choose between. However each aspect's effect on individual shoppers came in different amounts. Those constrained on resources and funds prioritized prices and convenience over searching for the more expensive, harder to find organic options. However those really in tune with produce seemed to value appeal less and focused more on longevity. Even the way in which the participants learned about produce also had large overlaps. Many gaining the bulk of their knowledge from family-centered experiences with jobs here and there providing expertise in certain niche areas of cooking and farming. Lastly, participants were all willing to learn more about picking the better produce, thus we will try to focus on these aspects in our decisions.


### Participants
**Brian** is a senior Williams college student who lives off-campus, and does not have a college-run meal plan. As a result, he has to prepare food for himself daily, and must make a trip to the grocery store every week or so. We conducted our contextual inquiry in the produce section of the North Adams Stop and Shop.
Brian spent a year working as a line cook in a restaurant, so he is comfortable with a variety of produce. However, he expressed a desire to become more familiar with seasonality.

**Mark** is a senior Williams college student who lives on-campus, and is a board member of the Williams cooking club, Moo-Mami. We performed a contextual inquiry at Stop and Shop where Mark stepped us through his produce shopping routine.
Mark’s main priority when selecting produce was the price. Though he does have a preference for locally grown produce, he explained that Stop and Shop does not offer him a wide enough selection such that that consideration was possible.

**Patricia** is a professor at Williams College. We performed a retrospective contextual interview in her office. Because she is very busy with work, her main priority in grocery shopping seemed to be convenience. She also expressed an affinity for cooking Mexican food, and as a result her staple ingredients were different than our participants who did not favor any type of regional cuisine.

**Jane** is an administrative assistant at Williams College. We performed a retrospective contextual interview in her office. She has experience working on a farm and owns a garden, so she is less likely to reject irregular-looking produce. Additionally, she expressed a preference for organic produce.


### Themes and Process
The participants all seemed to judge their produce in three steps:

First, they would pick produce based on its intended use. That is, they didn’t simply pick the most ripe fruits and vegetable that would be tastiest if eaten right away, they judged the produce on how suitable it was for their meal plans.
A couple examples:
 - Mark looked for juicy tomatoes rather than meaty tomatoes because they were better for the dish he planned to cook.
 - Brian looked for fairly green bananas because he did not intend to eat them until later that week.

Second they would compare the choices that fit the first criteria in terms of price, often searching for the cheapest acceptable choice. It may be of note to mention that two of our participants were college students, so this may be a bias from our small sample size.
Third they would judge the produce on their default standards. This mainly included the absence of blemishes, but certain produce had their own default standards.

In regard to which produce to buy, it seemed that most participants had a selection of produce that they bought constantly because these fruits and vegetables were regularly used in their cooking. On top of that, often participants would decide to make specific dishes ahead of time and would then decide to buy specific ingredients.

We identified these themes by discussing our experiences conducting the various inquiries.


### Task Analysis Questions
**Who is going to use the design?**
This design could be useful for people who need help selecting produce, specifically young people who are relatively new to shopping for themselves. This design could also be useful to people who would like to learn more about seasonal produce offerings.

**What tasks do they now perform?**
Many people do not have a clear method for selecting produce, mainly relying on vague lessons taught throughout their childhood. For produce that they have not encountered before, people need to either guess how to select it or look it up prior to going to the grocery store.

**What tasks are desired?**
We want people to be able to select produce with more confidence, by showing them how to gauge the ripeness of produce and understanding how quickly it will continue to ripen. Many people also expressed a desire to better understand what produce is in season or locally grown.

**How are the tasks learned?**
People can learn to judge produce by sight, feel, smell, or even sound. By exposing people to proper produce selecting habits, they may be able to acquire a lifetime skill. Also, if exposed to information about produce seasonality, people will gradually internalize that knowledge and develop better, more sustainable shopping habits.

**Where are the tasks performed?**
The tasks should be performed during a trip to the grocery store. The most effective time for people to learn proper produce selection techniques is while selecting produce.

**What is the relationship between the person and data?**
If people learn better produce shopping habits, they will pick more delicious vegetables and be more inclined to maintain a nutritious diet. Additionally, learning to appreciate local vegetables will help consumers to cut down on the amount of produce which must be imported from far away, ultimately reducing their carbon footprint.

**What other tools does the person have?**
Some people have already learned methods that can be used to effectively select good produce from life experience, but this requires people to seek out new information when confronted with a new fruit or vegetable. And Seasonal information can be found on the internet, but this would require people to search for this information and remember it themselves.

**How do people communicate with each other?**
The core element of this app is for personal education, so communication is not a huge priority. However, users will be able to communicate with one another by sharing recipes and examples of good or bad produce.

**How often are the tasks performed?**
The task of grocery shopping is typically performed every one or two weeks, but this can vary from person to person.

**What are the time constraints on the tasks?**
These tasks do not have time constraints, how long the user takes is entirely up to how discerning the user would like to be in their selections.

**What happens when things go wrong?**
If a user accidentally chooses a bad piece of produce, it can discourage them from including it in their diet in the future.
