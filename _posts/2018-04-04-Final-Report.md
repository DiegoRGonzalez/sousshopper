# SousShopper -- A helping hand outside the kitchen


### Our Dream Team

Justin Smilan - Project Lead, Writer, Storyboarder

Diego Gonzalez - Task Manager, Storyboarder

David Ariyibi - Artist, Chief UI Designer


### Problem and Solution Overview

Between online recipe sites, instructional videos on YouTube, and the ubiquitous Tasty content cluttering our Facebook feeds, the internet has made it easier than ever to learn about cooking. But in spite of all the information available about what to do in the kitchen, an online culinary education fails to teach amateur cooks to navigate their local grocery store. Our proposed solution is to create a phone app which will help shoppers become more confident in the produce aisle by teaching them how to recognize the ripeness of fruits and vegetables, familiarizing them with the seasonality of produce, and providing nutritional information about the goods they eat.


### Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants
Brian is a senior Williams college student who lives off-campus, and does not have a college-run meal plan. As a result, he has to prepare food for himself daily, and must make a trip to the grocery store every week or so. We conducted our contextual inquiry in the produce section of the North Adams Stop and Shop. Brian spent a year working as a line cook in a restaurant, so he is comfortable with a variety of produce. However, he expressed a desire to become more familiar with seasonality.
Mark is a senior Williams college student who lives on-campus, and is a board member of the Williams cooking club, Moo-Mami. We performed a contextual inquiry at Stop and Shop where Mark stepped us through his produce shopping routine. Mark’s main priority when selecting produce was the price. Though he does have a preference for locally grown produce, he explained that Stop and Shop does not offer him a wide enough selection such that that consideration was possible.
Patricia is a professor at Williams College. We performed a retrospective contextual interview in her office. Because she is very busy with work, her main priority in grocery shopping seemed to be convenience. She also expressed an affinity for cooking Mexican food, and as a result her staple ingredients were different than our participants who did not favor any type of regional cuisine.
Jane is an administrative assistant at Williams College. We performed a retrospective contextual interview in her office. She has experience working on a farm and owns a garden, so she is less likely to reject irregular-looking produce. Additionally, she expressed a preference for organic produce.
**Describe why we used these methods**
### Design Research Results and Themes
The participants all seemed to judge their produce in three steps:
First, they would pick produce based on its intended use. That is, they didn’t simply pick the most ripe fruits and vegetable that would be tastiest if eaten right away, they judged the produce on how suitable it was for their meal plans. A couple examples:
Mark looked for juicy tomatoes rather than meaty tomatoes because they were better for the dish he planned to cook.
Brian looked for fairly green bananas because he did not intend to eat them until later that week.
Second they would compare the choices that fit the first criteria in terms of price, often searching for the cheapest acceptable choice. It may be of note to mention that two of our participants were college students, so this may be a bias from our small sample size. Third they would judge the produce on their default standards. This mainly included the absence of blemishes, but certain produce had their own default standards.
In regard to which produce to buy, it seemed that most participants had a selection of produce that they bought constantly because these fruits and vegetables were regularly used in their cooking. On top of that, often participants would decide to make specific dishes ahead of time and would then decide to buy specific ingredients.
We identified these themes by discussing our experiences conducting the various inquiries.
 


### Task Analysis Questions
**Who is going to use the design?**
This design could be useful for people who need help selecting produce, specifically young people who are relatively new to shopping for themselves. This design could also be useful to people who would like to learn more about seasonal produce offerings.

**What tasks do they now perform?**
Many people do not have a clear method for selecting produce, mainly relying on vague lessons taught throughout their childhood. For produce that they have not encountered before, people need to either guess how to select it or look it up prior to going to the grocery store.

**What tasks are desired?**
We want people to be able to select produce with more confidence, by showing them how to gauge the ripeness of produce and understanding how quickly it will continue to ripen. Many people also expressed a desire to better understand what produce is in season or locally grown.

**How are the tasks learned?**
People can learn to judge produce by sight, feel, smell, or even sound. By exposing people to proper produce selecting habits, they may be able to acquire a lifetime skill. Also, if exposed to information about produce seasonality, people will gradually internalize that knowledge and develop better, more sustainable shopping habits.

**Where are the tasks performed?**
The tasks should be performed during a trip to the grocery store. The most effective time for people to learn proper produce selection techniques is while selecting produce.

**What is the relationship between the person and data?**
If people learn better produce shopping habits, they will pick more delicious vegetables and be more inclined to maintain a nutritious diet. Additionally, learning to appreciate local vegetables will help consumers to cut down on the amount of produce which must be imported from far away, ultimately reducing their carbon footprint.

**What other tools does the person have?**
Some people have already learned methods that can be used to effectively select good produce from life experience, but this requires people to seek out new information when confronted with a new fruit or vegetable. And Seasonal information can be found on the internet, but this would require people to search for this information and remember it themselves.

**How do people communicate with each other?**
The core element of this app is for personal education, so communication is not a huge priority. However, users will be able to communicate with one another by sharing recipes and examples of good or bad produce.

**How often are the tasks performed?**
The task of grocery shopping is typically performed every one or two weeks, but this can vary from person to person.

**What are the time constraints on the tasks?**
These tasks do not have time constraints, how long the user takes is entirely up to how discerning the user would like to be in their selections.

**What happens when things go wrong?**
If a user accidentally chooses a bad piece of produce, it can discourage them from including it in their diet in the future.


### Proposed Design Sketches (edit to 500 words)

#### Design 1: Grocery List App

This design is centered around the creation of a grocery list and the management of bought produce. First a user fills their list with what they would like to buy. From here, they can look up information about the produce as well as selection techniques. Once the produce has been bought, it moves to the pantry list that keeps track of what has been  bought and alerts the user when the produce is about to spoil.

![Grocery List App Mock-Up](/sousshopper/img/listmockup.jpg)

This design can accomplish the following tasks:

##### Build Grocery List Based On Seasonality
To accomplish this task, the user first opens the app and is shown an empty list. From here they click the bottom left corner to add produce. Then they sort the produce by season and adds produce that is currently in season.

##### Learn Nutritional Info About Produce - Medium Task
To accomplish this task, the user first must add the desired produce to their list. From here they must select the question mark button next to the produce. At this point, they will be brought to the info page of the produce where they can see nutritional information.

##### Convenient Reminder for when broccoli is in Season - Easy Task
To accomplish this task, the user first must add the desired produce to their list. From here they must select the question mark button enxt to the produce. Then they must click the bell icon in the corner of the produce's image. They will then be asked whether they would like to set an alert. Once they have said yes, they will be reminded when the time comes.

##### Determine when Eggplants are in season - Easy Task
To accomplish this task, the user can do one of two things. They can add the produce to their list and then bring up the produces info page to check its season. They could also sort the produce by season in the lookup menu and see where eggplants fall into.

#### Design 2: Discovery-Based App

This design is based on encouraging the user to discover new types of seasonal produce. When the user opens the app, they are greeted with a bunch of recipes based on ingredients that are in season to generate interest from the user. Additionally, they can browse through vegetables in season or be shown one at random. The user is then able to discover more specific information about produce on their individual pages.

![Discovery-Based App Mock-Up](/sousshopper/img/DiscoveryMockup.jpg)

##### Learn how to cook unfamiliar produce

To accomplish the user must simply open the app and begin exploring! This whole design is about discovering new produce and learning how to cook with it. The highlighted recipes give inspiration for various dishes, and the information on each fruit or vegetable’s produce page provides details that will give the user a greater understanding of how to use it as an ingredient.

##### Selecting produce based on ripeness

To accomplish this task, the user must simply navigate to the item they want to know more about and read. This page will contain information about how to judge the ripeness of the fruit or vegetable by sight and feel, as well as examples of different degrees of ripeness.

##### Determine when favorite fruits and vegetables are in season

To accomplish this task, the user must use the favorites system. On each fruit or vegetable’s individual page, there is a favorites toggle on the top right of the screen. The app will then let you know when this produce is in season.
##### Learn nutritional information about produce

To accomplish this task, the user must simply navigate to the item they want to know more about and read. This page will contain nutritional information about the fruit or vegetable.

#### Design 3: Produce Encyclopedia App

This design focuses on the concept of amassing produce knowledge as well as categorizing your produce for any future reasons. It uses the idea of a pantry as the sort of home, with various crates holding a certain category of produce, be it fruits, vegetables, local goods, seasonal goods, etc. The pantry also comes with a favorites category as the top crate. From clicking any of the crates, the contents are pored out in a list where you can click on any of the produce in said list. Upon clicking on the produce, a page of nutritional facts about the item appears with tabs to other aspects about the item like its seasonal and freshness information for when/how best to buy it. Each page also comes with a button to add it to your favorites or set a reminder for some point in the future. From the home pantry, there is also a search icon which allows you to search the entire produce encyclopedia for any item typed in.

##### Selecting Produce Based on Ripeness and Shelf Life
To accomplish this task, the user opens the app and either categorically chooses an item through the crates or directly searches for an item. From here, they click on the freshness/seasonal tab to find the information needed.

##### Determine when Eggplants are in Season
To accomplish this task, the user does the above but specifically for eggplants. In the freshness/seasonal page, there is a of seasons (or months) with a bar hovering over the sections of the seasons where eggplants would be in season.

##### Learn Nutritional Info About Produce
To accomplish this task, the user opens the app and either categorically chooses an item through the crates or directly searches for an item. From here, they can read about the basic nutritional information about the specific produce item in question. Be it the amount of calories in a serving size, amount needed to eat for a certain diet, certain categories/recommended produce to eat as an alternative or complement, etc, this is a page of information with possible links out to related produce pages.

##### Convenient Reminder for when broccoli is in Season
To accomplish this task, the user does the above but specifically for broccoli. From any of broccoli's pages, there is a floating button on the bottom right which when pressed allows you to add broccoli to your favorites crate or set some kind of reminder. The reminder can come with a message, so if you navigate to the freshness/seasonal page, you can copy the seasonal data into the reminder message. The reminder comes in the form of push notifications based on what ever time you set.


### Written Scenarios
##### Selecting Produce base on Ripeness and shelf life 
Genevieve is an undergraduate student who has moved into a new apartment for a summer internship at an investment firm. Because she has little free time, she only gets to go to the grocery store once every two weeks, which can make shopping for fruit very difficult. She wants to buy bananas in varying degrees of ripeness so that she can have one for breakfast every day until her next visit to the store. At the produce aisle, Genevieve opens her SousShopper phone app and searches for bananas. Once she has navigated to the appropriate page she compares the bananas in the store to the images on the ripeness spectrum, and selects 3 bananas which are ripe now, 4 which will be ripe in 4-6 days, 3 that will ripen in 1-1.5 weeks, and 4 that should be ripe in 1.5-2 weeks.
##### Determine when favorite produce is in season
Cindy is a grad student who is living alone for the first time. In the past, she has had the help of others to cook and is not too familiar with the seasonality of produce. While in the store she happens upon the eggplants, a favorite of hers, and decides to buy some. However, upon examining the selections, the eggplants seem strange for some reason. Cindy wonders when the eggplants are in season and pulls up the SousShopper app to find out. Soon she discovers that eggplants are at their best from late summer to early fall. Seeing as it is spring, she decides to pass up on the eggplants for the moment.
