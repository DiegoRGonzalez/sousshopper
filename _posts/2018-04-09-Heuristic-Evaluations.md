### Paper Prototype
![Paper Prototype Overview](/sousshopper/img/PaperPrototype/overview.jpg)

Overall, our paper prototype had a number of glaring flaws. It’s pretty embarrassing, but we forgot to include exits on most of our pages. We also forgot to implement a favorites system...despite advertising favorites as the first item on the home screen. This is largely because we got so excited by our fancy paper implementation of sliders, we managed to skip over the basics. We also neglected many of these considerations because during the design process, we were thinking in terms of the tasks we would ask people to complete, instead of an environment for users to explore. On that note, we have a lot of links that don’t go anywhere. We felt the need to include filler to populate our interface, but testers were frustrated when they touched the tomato icon and were greeted with a 404 screen. We learned mostly that we have a lot more groundwork to do, but we also got some good ideas for how to move forward with our design. We’re looking forward to creating a new iteration and conducting more user tests!
