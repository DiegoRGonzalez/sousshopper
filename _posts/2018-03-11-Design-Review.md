The two tasks we decided to emphasize are 1) selecting produce based on ripeness and 2) determining when favorite fruits or vegetables are in season. We chose these tasks because they felt the most fundamental to our app. The mission of SousShopper is to help people who are not confident in produce aisle to learn how to pick out better fruits and vegetables while familiarizing them with the concept of seasonality, so this felt like a no-brainer. Additionally, we found that many of the other tasks were either derivative of these two or trivial. Building a grocery list based on seasonality is a specific task informed by learning about seasonality. We didn’t want to base our design on creating convenient reminders, because then the core functionality of our app would be push notifications. For our final design, we decided to mostly follow the “produce encyclopedia” design, while borrowing a few visual elements from the “discovery-based” design. We felt our “grocery list” design was overly complicated, and contained too many features that were irrelevant to the app’s identity, namely meal-planning. Considering there are other apps on the market that already do meal-planning, we decided it was better to drop this approach. We decided against the “discovery-based” design because, well, it was a bit silly. Described within the group as “Buzzfeed for produce,” this design emphasized catching eyes over conveying straightforward information to the user, and would require a massive amount of curated content to remain relevant. The “produce encyclopedia” model suits our target customers best because we imagine this app will be used mostly by people who want to be able to quickly look up information about produce while at the market, or whenever curiosity happens to strike them. The additional features in the other designs would only inhibit them. Here are the two storyboards that we drew:
