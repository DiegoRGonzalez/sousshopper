## Usability Tests
### Testing 1: Stephen
 - Facilitator: Diego

Our first participant, Stephen, is a Williams College student who has been known to go grocery shopping. We chose to use Stephen as a participant because he uses various apps to help him navigate through his day. He has a weight calculator, a physical fitness app, and a grocery list app, among others, that he uses to help manage these tasks. For these reasons, he seemed like a person to test out our design with. The test was conducted in Stephen's common room in order to make it convenient for him. Diego conducted this usability test and acted as the "human computer" as well as the "flight attendant." One thing that was learned during the testing process was the need to go over the exact scenario in which this app would be used. There was some confusion over what stage of the grocery shopping the test would take place in, but after some clarification there was no more confusion. For future tests, we will make sure to extensively go over the scenario as well as ask participants if they fully understand the scenario before beginning the test.

### Testing 2: Sam
 - Facilitator: David

Our second participant Sam, is also a Williams College student. She recently started buying groceries for herself and is interested particularly in apps that let her explore food options and plan meals. However, she uses planning and tracking apps daily. We chose Sam because she can offer a perspective of a user who is not too familiar with the subject matter but is comfortable enough using the platform. The environment was a neutral space in Sam’s dorm. This was chosen out of convenience for both the participant. As for the protocol, Sam was given background information about her role as a shopper where she had a few tasks to fulfill while shopping that utilized the app. While completing the tasks, Sam was to think-aloud about anything she was doing or noticing concerning her ability to perform the task. David performed the roles of the computer as well as the flight attendant. With Sam's consent, the audio of the testing was also recorded. In this test, the main revisions added to the protocol were giving more of background information, and recording the test As for the prototype, back-buttons and more status indicators were added. Sam's main points on the design

### Testing 3: Daniela
 - Facilitator: Justin

Our third participant, Daniela, is yet another Williams College student. She did not start grocery shopping until her second year of college, and now does it occasionally. She was not exposed to a wide variety of vegetables growing up, and is interested in incorporating more into her diet for health reasons. Daniela offers the perspective of a user who is curious about new types of produce, and would rely on the app heavily to learn methods of selecting these unfamiliar fruits and vegetables. The testing was conducted in Daniela’s room for her convenience. She was given an explanation of what the usability test would entail and instructed to think aloud about any impressions she had regarding the design. Daniela was then given two tasks. Justin performed the roles of the human computer and the flight attendant. For reference purposes, the audio from the test was recorded with Daniela’s consent. Daniela’s largest concern was that the written content of the ripeness slider should be more fleshed-out and include more information regarding texture. Additionally she expressed that, while she found the navigation system perfectly usable, older and less tech-savvy users might find it confusing.


## Overall Results
### Main Screen/Pantry List
 - App's starting screen caused confusion as to where in the app the user was. - *Severity:* 2

## Final Paper Prototype


## Revisions
### Main Screen/Pantry List


### Seasonal Chart Infographic
Some initially did not even notice it was there since the words describing the seasonality of the produce was already next to the infographic. After some discussion, he agreed that the addition of colors would help to distinguish the various parts of the chart.
