## Usability Tests
### Testing 1: Stephen
 - Facilitator: Diego

Our first participant, Stephen, is a Williams College student who has been known to go grocery shopping. We chose to use Stephen as a participant because he uses various apps to help him navigate through his day. He has a weight calculator, a physical fitness app, and a grocery list app, among others, that he uses to help manage these tasks. For these reasons, he seemed like a person to test out our design with. The test was conducted in Stephen's common room in order to make it convenient for him. Diego conducted this usability test and acted as the "human computer" as well as the "flight attendant." One thing that was learned during the testing process was the need to go over the exact scenario in which this app would be used. There was some confusion over what stage of the grocery shopping the test would take place in, but after some clarification there was no more confusion. For future tests, we will make sure to extensively go over the scenario as well as ask participants if they fully understand the scenario before beginning the test.

### Testing 2: Sam
 - Facilitator: David

Our second participant Sam, is also a Williams College student. She recently started buying groceries for herself and is interested particularly in apps that let her explore food options and plan meals. However, she uses planning and tracking apps daily. We chose Sam because she can offer a perspective of a user who is not too familiar with the subject matter but is comfortable enough using the platform. The environment was a neutral space in Sam’s dorm. This was chosen out of convenience for both the participant. As for the protocol, Sam was given background information about her role as a shopper where she had a few tasks to fulfill while shopping that utilized the app. While completing the tasks, Sam was to think-aloud about anything she was doing or noticing concerning her ability to perform the task. David performed the roles of the computer as well as the flight attendant. With Sam's consent, the audio of the testing was also recorded. In this test, the main revisions added to the protocol were giving more of background information, and recording the test As for the prototype, back-buttons and more status indicators were added. Sam's main points on the design

### Testing 3: Daniela
 - Facilitator: Justin

Our third participant, Daniela, is yet another Williams College student. She did not start grocery shopping until her second year of college, and now does it occasionally. She was not exposed to a wide variety of vegetables growing up, and is interested in incorporating more into her diet for health reasons. Daniela offers the perspective of a user who is curious about new types of produce, and would rely on the app heavily to learn methods of selecting these unfamiliar fruits and vegetables. The testing was conducted in Daniela’s room for her convenience. She was given an explanation of what the usability test would entail and instructed to think aloud about any impressions she had regarding the design. Daniela was then given two tasks. Justin performed the roles of the human computer and the flight attendant. For reference purposes, the audio from the test was recorded with Daniela’s consent. Daniela’s largest concern was that the written content of the ripeness slider should be more fleshed-out and include more information regarding texture. Additionally she expressed that, while she found the navigation system perfectly usable, older and less tech-savvy users might find it confusing.


## Overall Results
### Main Screen/Pantry List
 - App's starting screen caused confusion as to where in the app the user was. - *Severity:* 2
 - A participant felt that the main page was too cluttered and would benefit from more pictures. - *Severity:* 2
 - A participant mentioned that the pantry list was very confusing to read, especially due to many vague categories. - *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Unnecessary/vague crates were removed from main screen.

### Seasonal Chart Infographic
 - Participants thought the seasonal chart was confusing to read. - *Severity:* 1

### Ripeness Scale
 - Descriptions beneath the pictures in the scale were subjective towards one type of ripeness. - *Severity:* 3
 - There was no explanation for why there was no ripeness scale for apples. - *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Descriptions were altered to be less subjective.

### Favorites
 - There was a *Favorites* crate at the top of the home screen without the functionality of actually adding produce to the crate. *Severity:* 2
#### Revision:
 - Clickable stars, indicating whether or not a certain produce was in the *Favorites*, were added as well as a separate produce list interface.

## Revisions
### Main Screen/Pantry List
The main issues with the main screen were that the pantry metaphor used to describe the page was not intuitive to the participant in certain important aspects. To a first-time user, the navigation from the main page was not designed in a way as to be functionally intuitive. Therefore there was no indication of where to go for completing tasks. A participant felt that the main page was far too cluttered with unnecessary crates, like *Athletic* and *Dieting*. The participant also stressed that more pictures would benefit the app since the app is meant to be more visual-based. The revisions employed removed the unnecessary/vague crates from main screen. While there are now less options, the three crates remaining, *Favorites*, *Local*, and *Seasonal*, all have direct, relevant purposes and allow for the user to not have to choose between many options.

### Back Buttons/404 Page
The error of not including back buttons was a grave mistake on the design of the app. Other than the *404 Page*, there were no buttons to get back to a previous page. This prevented participants from backtracking if an error was made or transitioning from one task to another. The revisions employed added back buttons arrows to the top-left corner of all pages but the main screen. Therefore, participants could freely navigate the pages. As of later thought, the *404 Page* came up consistently as a mild annoyance to the participants and gave off the impression that the these pages would not actually be found in the real version of the app. Thus after the heuristic evaluations and the first testing, the *404 Page* was removed and replaced with a verbal explanation by the computer for why a certain page could not be accessed.
