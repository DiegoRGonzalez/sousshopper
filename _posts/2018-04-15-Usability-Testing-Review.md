## Usability Tests
### Testing 1: Stephen
 - Facilitator: Diego
Our first participant, Stephen, is a Williams College student who has been known to go grocery shopping. We chose to use Stephen as a participant because he uses various apps to help him navigate through his day. He has a weight calculator, a physical fitness app, and a grocery list app, among others, that he uses to help manage these tasks. For these reasons, he seemed like a person to test out our design with. The test was conducted in Stephen's common room in order to make it convenient for him. Diego conducted this usability test and acted as the "human computer" as well as the "flight attendant." One thing that was learned during the testing process was the need to go over the exact scenario in which this app would be used. There was some confusion over what stage of the grocery shopping the test would take place in, but after some clarification there was no more confusion. For future tests, we will make sure to extensively go over the scenario as well as ask participants if they fully understand the scenario before beginning the test.

### Testing 2: Sam
 - Facilitator: David
Our second participant Sam, is also a Williams College student. She recently started buying groceries for herself and is interested particularly in apps that let her explore food options and plan meals. However, she uses planning and tracking apps daily. We chose Sam because she can offer a perspective of a user who is not too familiar with the subject matter but is comfortable enough using the platform. The environment chosen was a neutral space in Samâ€™s dorm. This was chosen out of convenience for both the participant and the facilitator. The protocol for the test included Sam being put in the role of a shopper where she had a few tasks to fulfill using the app while shopping. While completing the tasks, Sam was to think-aloud about anything she was doing or noticing. David performed the roles of the computer as well as the flight attendant. In order to keep better notes, the audio of the testing was also recorded. Adding more of the background information as well as recording the audio were the main revisions added to the current protocol, while back-buttons, more fleshed-out pages, and generally more status indicators were added to the prototype.
