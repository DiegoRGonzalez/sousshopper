Sous Shopper has finished our first digital prototype, and it doesn’t look too bad, if we don’t say so ourselves.

Be careful who you call ugly in high school, amirite? Here is how we will accomplish our primary tasks using this design.

### Task 1: Selecting produce based on ripeness

![Home Page](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Page1.png)

This is our home page. From here, let’s find out how to judge if a banana is ripe or not. Let’s search alphabetically…

![Alphabetical Nav Page](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Alphabetical.png)

From here, we can see bananas pretty easily (we know there are more than 3 types of produce, this is just a prototype). Let’s go ahead and click on them.

We’ve successfully navigated to our individual produce page. At the bottom, we see an image of a banana with a description of how it feels and tastes. By clicking on the arrow, we can advance to the next stage of ripeness.

Here we see information about a slightly riper banana. We can go forwards to see more information, or backwards to recap. It looks like we’ve accomplished our task!

### Task 2: Determining when favorite produce is in season

Apologies for the redundancy, but this task is accomplished in much the same way. Let’s say we want to find out when tomatoes are in season. We can navigate to the tomato page in the same fashion as before, or we can observe the large, eye-catching banner which is telling us they’re in season right now. 

![Tomatoes 1](/sousshopper/img/HiFi Assets/HiFi Assets/Tomato1.png)

Clicking on that button brings us to this page, where we can see the tomato’s seasonality in the chart on the upper left-hand side. It looks like tomatoes are in season from early Summer to late Fall. Mission accomplished!





##Changes from Paper Prototype to Digital Mock-Up
From our paper prototype to our digital mock-up, we made a few substantial changes.

### Adopted “Feature, Search, and Browse” Pattern
A few of our test subjects mentioned that they felt that our main page was not aesthetically pleasing enough, that it had too many words. Inspired by the necessity to add more images to our main page, we adopted the “Feature, Search, and Browse” pattern from Jenifer Tidwell’s “Designing Interfaces” where we include a featured item as well as the functionality to browse various categories and search for specific items. We feel this has made our main page more aesthetically pleasing as well as allowing for produce discovery, a task that we identified but decided to not focus on. However, as this change both fixes an issue and naturally adds in a way to discovery produce, it seemed like a good fit.

### Removed Nutrition Facts and Meal Planning
On our produce pages in our paper prototype, we had tabs that would lead to that produce’s nutritional info as well as a list of meals that could be prepared using that produce. These functions were however not supported by our paper prototype as they were not the tasks that we were testing for. As they did not work, they simply added confusion to users. To rectify this, we removed those tabs from our design in an attempt to keep it simple.
